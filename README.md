# Graphs and python and D3 oh my!

I'm experimenting (semi-successfully) with making D3 run inline in a jupyter notebook.  I'm also playing with graph datastructures because they're awesome.  While I haven't successfully married a D3 force graph viz and a jupyter notebook, I have figured out some friction points with NetworkX and D3.  This may save you some time!  

To actually see the viz for now, unitl  I figure out the jupyter marriage, run an http server from the viz directory and open local-host:8000 in a browser.   

For non-python folks there is a markdown version of the notebook as well.
